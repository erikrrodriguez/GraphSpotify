# Graph Spotify
Graph various stats of artists or albums provided by Spotify. Explore an artist's career or an album's progression.

Inspired by Kevin Wu's GraphTV project: http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/ and Charlie Thompson's blog post on finding the most depressing Radiohead song using R: http://rcharlie.com/2017-02-16-fitteR-happieR/

Uses Spotipy Library:https://github.com/plamere/spotipy for API access, Pylast:https://github.com/pylast/pylast for LastFM API access and Bokeh for data visualization.

Currently a work in progress. Eventually intended to be a webapp.
